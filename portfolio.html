			<h1 id="Dimee">Mate Roommate Finder Application</h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Mate/Mate-Showcase.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Most successful roommmates are ones that are found through friends. Mate is a web application, powered by facebook, that connects people with friends, and friends of friends, who are also looking for roommates.
				Most websites that help find roommates require that the user fill out a long list of questions that can take upwards of 15 minutes to complete. This is because they are searching through thousands and thousands of potential matches. Mate is able to eliminate this step and use a simple filter because it is only matching you with first, second and third degree connections.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="12">

				<img src="PortfolioImages/Mate/Mate-Wire.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Mate/Mate-Wire3.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I did lots of drawing and wireframing before building the application. A photo of the potential roommate, and a photo of the apartment are the two main images displayed on the screen. Apartment perks, a way to contact the roommate and added features to filter by neighborhood and by rent are just a couple of things addressed.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Mate/Mate-Product.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				The images are of a prototype I created using Bootstrap. I heavily modified the css and used a variety of plugins to get the desired aesthetic and functionality.
			</p>

			<h1 id="Dimee">UrbanBound eBook</h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Urbanbound_Ebook/Ebook0.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I designed a thirty two page eBook for <a id="intext-link" href="http://www.urbanbound.com" target="_blank">Urbanbound,</a> a Chicago startup that helps corporations relocate employees. The content was directed at realtors, a group of suppliers that Urbanbound wanted to focus on attracting and retaining. I designed the eBook to be easily read, and used lots of visuals throughout the book.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="2">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Urbanbound_Ebook/Ebook14.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Urbanbound_Ebook/Ebook6.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I worked closely with a content marketer who wrote the copy of the eBook. He called out areas that needed emphasis and I laid the material out on the page and created visuals to compliment the content. Urbanbound was thrilled with the result and plans to publish the eBook on their site in 2015. The eBook is just one part of an entire inbound marketing campaign I worked on for them.

			<h1 id="Dimee">Cambodian Water Filter</h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/WaterFilter1.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				iDE Cambodia has been distributing water filtration solutions to the Cambodian market for nearly 10 years. Their first product, the Tunsai water filter, has spawned an entire market of competition and vastly increased the availability of clean water to the rural population. After nearly a decade of production, the tooling used for the plastic bucket and lid had reached the end of its life-cycle. iDE wanted to develop a refined product to better serve it's core customer base, provide an attractive option for NGO customers and to perform better in retail sales.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="12">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/WaterFilter2.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/WaterFilter3.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/WaterFilter4.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I planned and conducted visits with six rural customers and with five store owners who were either current retailers of the filter or who formerly sold the filter. I learned a lot about what was working well with the current product, and what needed improvement. "Ants lay eggs under the lid so I flipped it over but then it blew away, so I put a box on top of it," was one thing I learned from a rural customer. One retailer we spoke with had lost the contact number for Hydrologic so she couldn't order more even though she was out of stock.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">

				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Sketch3.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Sketch1.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Sketch4.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Improved aesthetics, more accessory storage, taller spigot height, tighter gaps and seals, simplified product transport, reduced retail shelf space and better communication with retailers were some of the main points that needed to be addressed in the design. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">

				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Concept2.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Concept4.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Concept3.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Four of the concepts were refined, built in CAD and tested with customers again. Though customers liked two of the concepts, there was a clear winner when it came to considering manufacturing costs.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">

				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Product5.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Product3.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Product4.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I created paper prototypes and refined the design in SolidWorks. The design addressed all necessary improvements and met a production cost of $6.50.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Water_Filter/Product1.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				The filter design has been released for tooling and is expected to hit the market in March of 2015.

		<div id="UsabilityStudy">	

			<h1 id="Dimee">Bonfyre Usability Study</h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/Bonfyre1.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I performed a usability study for Bonfyre, a Chicago startup, to better understand active user habits. The study uncovered insights about what is working well for users and where opportunity for improvement lies. The study was separated into three main activities, a usability assessment, a feature use assessment, and a sharing habit assessment.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="2">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/Bonfyre_Page_1.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/Bonfyre_Page_2.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I recruited users based on their activity within the app. 2-3 users were "super users," or very active, 2-3 were average users or active, and 2-3 were moderate users or moderately active. The sessions were conducted individually and were video recorded. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/BonfyreStudy1.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/BonfyreStudy2.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/BonfyreStudy3.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Bonfyre/BonfyreStudy4.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				After 6-8 weeks of using the application, users still found some of the basic functions of the application difficult to use, like starting a new bonfyre (chat) within the application and inviting friends to join it. There were also features that users either didn't use or didn't understand, like the mystery image feature. The name of it scared users and more than one were worried that it would take a random image from their photo album and post it to a group. There were many other findings from the study that will influence future Bonfyre development.

		<div id="VolunteerApp">	

			<h1 id="Dimee">Volunteer Management App</h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Volunteer_Showcase.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				The volunteer management application is a Ruby Gem that is meant to be added to small non-profit's websites to help them manage their volunteers. Many small non-profits are still managing their volunteer events and schedules manually. The application will support these small organizations who are constantly trying to do more with less. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Wireframe_Page_01.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Wireframe_Page_02.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Wireframe_Page_05.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Wireframe_Page_04.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				As the UX designer and visual designer on the project, I worked with a front-end developer and a back-end developer to make the application real. Part of testing the application's functionality was making <a id="intext-link" href="Interactive-Wireframes/Wireframes.html" target="_blank">clickable wireframes </a> with InVision App. I learned a lot from watching people use the wireframes and changed the design to make it easier to use.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Volunteer_Page_04.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Volunteer_Page_05.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Volunteer_Page_06.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Volunteer_Page_07.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				When I spoke with employees at these organizations, they said that it is important for them to know when volunteers meet certain qualifications. For example, if they're going to deliver food to people in need, they must have their own vehicle and a valid driver's license. When signing up for an event, there is a form to fill out stating that you meet all qualifications for that specific event. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/Volunteer_Mgmt/Volunteer1.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p>
				In order to help the non-profits attract as many volunteers as they need, I designed the application to work seamlessly on both desktops and mobile. The application is completely responsive. 
			</p>

		<div id="CareBranchApp">	

			<h1 id="Dimee">CAREBRANCH App for Hospitals </h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/CareBranch/Carebranch1.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				The CAREBRANCH app was developed as a concept to improve communications between hospital staff and patients. Each patient would be able to log into their account and 'meet' their caretakers. They could contact their doctors if they had a questions and could read about their procedure. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/CareBranch/Carebranch2.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Small pieces of information and empowering services can take some of the burden off of patients who are dealing with debilitating medical conditions that can render them feeling powerless, especially while in the hospital. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/CareBranch/Carebranch3.jpg"/>
			</div>

		<div id="SchoolFilter">	

			<h1 id="Dimee">Cambodian Water Filter for Schools</h1>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter1.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				There was an opportunity to promote and provide safe drinking water for the underserved Cambodian school market. Water that is currently offered to students is considered less ideal (less safe) than water brought from home and is only consumed if alternative beverage options are not available.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter3.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter4.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter5.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter7.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				The design goal was to develop a high-capacity water filter to compliment Hydrologic's existing line of domestic water filters. To develop a successful high capacity water filter it must hold an appropriate volume of water for a classroom, be able to be maintained by the students, and provide drinking water that is of equal or better quality than their drinking water at home.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter8.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				I conducted research to better understand the needs for each of the high capacity filter target markets. The research results directly influenced the high capacity water filter design and guided decision making throughout the development process. I visited with schools in Kampong Speu, and Takeo and interviewed directors, teachers and students ranging in age from 4-15 years old.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter9.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter10.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter11.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter12.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Students at some schools were drinking untreated pond water even though they knew it wasn't safe to drink. They didn't have any other options. Half of the schools that we visited had filters that were donated within the last 15 years but none of them were still using the filters. 
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="1">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter14.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Previous attempts at supplying schools with high capacity filters have not succeeded. A few crucial details will determine the success of a new high capacity filter. Hydrologic staff must be present when recipients receive their filters to educate them on how to use and maintain the filters and to set up a replacement schedule. They also must follow up with recipients to ensure success and make repairs if necessary.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="22">

				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter15.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter16.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter17.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				We developed concepts that supported our research findings and that met target production cost. One of the most challenging constraints was to design a high capacity filter that children can maintain. 20 liters was an ideal amount of water, but 20 liters is heavy for an eight year old to carry. Some of our solutions separated the water jugs into two, more manageable, 10 liter jugs.
			</p>

			<div class="photoset-grid" data-layout="11">
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter19.jpg"/>
				<img src="PortfolioImages/School_Filter/SchoolFilter20.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<p> 
				Hydrologic and iDE are currently pursuing funding for the community filter as a carbon finance project.
