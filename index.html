		<h2> about </h2>

		<p> I'm a UX designer with five years of experience designing physical products and services and am currently expanding my skillset to design in the digital space. </p>

		<p> For four years I worked as an industrial design consultant focused primarily on designing medical devices and have recently returned to the United States from Phnom Penh, Cambodia where I worked with iDE, a Denver based NGO, for an intense four months of research and product development. </p>

		<p> During my time in Cambodia, I worked closely with iDE and the Cambodian social enterprise, Hydrologic, to develop two water filtration products for underserved families, schools and health centers in rural areas of the country. My experience there solidified the importance of user centered design and the necessity to involve end-users early and often throughout the design process. </p>

		<p> I'm now enrolled in the product and design track at Startup Institute to bridge my knowledge gap from physical to digital products. I've been fortunate to work on some truly meaningful projects throughout my career and I'd love to join a team making a positive impact. </p>
